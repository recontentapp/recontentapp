# Contributing to Recontent.app

## Get started

In order to set up Recontent.app on your machine, git, docker, docker-compose, node.js & the AWS CLI need to be installed.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:recontentapp/recontentapp.git

cd recontentapp

# Start db & maildev containers
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Apply db migrations
yarn workspace db deploy

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Autogenerated files from OpenAPI schemas
yarn openapi:generate

# Start API server
yarn start:api

# Start Vite dev server
yarn start:app
```

## AWS services locally with LocalStack

Some Recontent.app features are based on AWS services like S3. In order to make them work locally without actually using AWS during development, [`localstack`](https://localstack.cloud) is used.

In order to set up `localstack` resources using the AWS CLI, you can define an AWS profile with the following values.

```sh
# ~/.aws/config
[profile recontent]
region=us-east-1
output=json
endpoint_url = http://localhost:4566

# ~/.aws/credentials
[recontent]
aws_access_key_id=test
aws_secret_access_key=test
```

Each AWS CLI command can then be ran while specifying this profile & a custom endpoint URL:

```sh
aws --profile recontent --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 s3api ls
```
